= Real-Time Fraud Detection with Data Microservices

=== Architecture overview

image::arch-1.jpg[Architecture]
image::arch-2.jpg[Architecture]

=== Requirements

* CloudFoundry (tested with pcfdev v0.66)
* Apache Geode (tested with http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/geode/1.0.0-incubating.M3/apache-geode-1.0.0-incubating.M3.tar.gz[apache-geode-1.0.0-incubating.M3] ) - to be replaced by GemFire 9.0 when that is released
* PostgreSQL (tested with 9.5.3) - to be replaced by Greenplum server once GemFire 9.0 is released
* Spring Cloud Dataflow (tested with 1.0.0.RELASE)
* Spark-redis (tested with v0.1.1) - installed from binray maven repository
  
=== Preparing the environment
* Download and install http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/geode/1.0.0-incubating.M3/apache-geode-1.0.0-incubating.M3.tar.gz[Apache Geode M3]. Export the variable `$GEODE_HOME`, pointing to your local `GemFire`/`Geode` server home.
```
export GEODE_HOME=<path to apache-geode-1.0.0-incubating.M3>
export PATH=$GEODE_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

* Edit the file `start-scdf-pcfdev.sh`, in order to satisfy your pcfdev environment info and SCDF binaries path. 
** Download the SCDF server from: http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/1.0.0.RELEASE/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar[spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar].
** Download the SCDF shell from: http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.0.0.RELEASE/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar[spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar]
* Edit the file `GemFireServer/startup.gfsh`, replacing the IPs with your local address on the pcfdev network (default is 192.168.11.1, for the pcfdev server running on 192.168.11.11). If in doubt, check your pcfdev VM Ip address.
* Edit the file `TransactionsEmulator/src/main/resources/application.properties`, replacing the `geodeUrl` variable with the correct Geode IP. 
* Start `pcfdev`, if not running yet. At least 6GB of memory is required!
```
cf dev start -m 6144
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation 
```
* Start `Greenplum` or `PostgreSQL`. See <<appendix1-postgresql-setup>> for instructions how to configure PostgreSQL.
** Use the DDL statements in `scripts/model_postgres.sql` to create the database model. 
** Import the data from tables using the csv files `scripts/pos_device.csv`, `scripts/zip_codes_states.csv` and `scripts/transaction.csv`.  This step won't be necessary when GemFire 9.0 is released (it will write transactions directly to Greenplum).
* Start GemFire/Geode using the script `GemFireServer/startup.sh`
* Start the Spring Cloud Dataflow server (or deploy it to pcfdev, if you prefer). Use the `start-scdf-pcdev.sh` script. Open http://192.168.11.1:9393/dashboard/index.html to acces the SCDF dashboard.

=== Buils all SDDF 1.0.2 apps localy. Enable the PMML processor.

* Clone the repository https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters

```
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters
cd spring-cloud-stream-app-starters
git fetch
git checkout tags/v1.0.2.RELEASE
```

* In `spring-cloud-stream-app-generator/pom.xml` uncomment the `PMML` processor:
```
<pmml-processor>
   <extraTestConfigClass>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.test.pmml.PmmlProcessorTestConfiguration.class</extraTestConfigClass>
</pmml-processor>
```

* Build all SCDF apps and install them in the local maven repository
```
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
./generateApps.sh
./mvnw clean install -f ./apps/pom.xml -DskipTests
```

=== Running the app

==== Setup

1 - Create the `gemfire` user-provided service in CF using the script `TransactionsConsole/cf-createservice.txt`. If necessary, modify it to point to your correct GemFire server.
```
cf cups gemfire -p '{"locatorHost":"192.168.11.1","locatorPort":"10334", "RestEndpoint":"http://192.168.11.1:8888/gemfire-api/v1/"}'
```

2 - Create the `gpdb` user-provided service in CF using the script `ClusteringService/cf-createservice.txt`. If necessary, modify the Greenplum/PostgreSQL server address and access credentials.
```
cf cups gpdb -p '{"URL":"jdbc:postgresql://192.168.11.1:5432/gemfire?user=pivotal&password=pivotal"}'
```

3 - Create a RabbitMQ service on CF called `rabbit`. This will be our SCDF transport.
```
cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard rabbit
```

4 - Create a Redis service on CF called `redis`. This will be used by both the ML Clustering app and the custom enricher.
```
cf create-service p-redis shared-vm redis
```

5 - Build and push the app `TransactionsConsole` to CF. There's a `manifest.yml` file on the application root folder.
```
cd ./TransactionsConsole
./gradlew clean build -x test
cf push -f ./manifest.yml
cd ..
```

6 - Open the `TransactionsConsole UI` (see the CF assigned host, probably http://transactions-console.local.pcfdev.io) and notice the US Map. 

7 - Now build and start the `TransactionsEmulator` app. Wait for it to be done with loading the devices and transactions start to be posted.
```
cd TransactionsEmulator
./gradlew clean build -x test
java -jar ./build/libs/PoS_Emulator-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

8 - Switch back to the `TransactionsConsole UI` and see transactions happening.

==== Creating and training the Machine Learning model

9 - Push the application `ClusteringService` to CF. 
```
cd ./ClusteringService
./gradlew clean build -x test
cf push -f ./manifest.yml
cd ..
```

10 - Once the app is running, trigger the model training by accessing the `/clustering/train` URL (probably http://clustering-service.local.pcfdev.io/clustering/train). Check the CF logs for that app and see spark querying Greenplum/PostgreSQL and building the model.  It will take a few minutes until the model is trained and the URL will return a few numbers.

11 - Now the model is trained, check its PMML representation using the url `/clustering/model.pmml.xml` (http://clustering-service.local.pcfdev.io/clustering/model.pmml.xml)

12 - Notice the clusters assigned on the three `<cluster>` tags by the bottom of the XML. Each cluster is a combination of average values for `distance from home location` and `transaction value` variables. The cluster with the lowest values is likely the one assigned to `low risk transactions`.

When evaluating the PMML model, each transaction will be assigned to the closest cluster, based on its distance from the home location (where customer does most transactions) and transaction value.


==== Creating the first two streams in SCDF 

Start SCDF shell:
```
java -Xmx128M -jar ./spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar
``` 

13 - Using the SCDF shell, import the common applications by running
```
dataflow:>app import --uri http://bit.ly/1-0-2-GA-stream-applications-rabbit-maven
```

14 - Build and install the `Enricher-processor` application and register it with SCDF.
```
cd Enricher-processor
./gradlew build install -x test
```

Register the Enricher in SCDF:
```
dataflow:>app register --name enrich --type processor --uri maven://io.pivotal.demo:enricher-processor:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT --force
```

15 - Create the first streams on either the SCDF Shell or the SCDF UI.  On the UI, use the following DSL:

```
fromgem = gemfire --region-name=Transaction --host-addresses=geode-server:10334 | enrich | log

eval = :fromgem.enrich > pmml --modelLocation=http://clustering-service.local.pcfdev.io/clustering/model.pmml.xml --inputs='field_0=payload.distance.doubleValue(),field_1=payload.value.doubleValue()'  --inputType='application/x-spring-tuple' --outputType='application/json' | log
```

Replace the `host-addresses` parameter with your GemFire locator address (usually `192.168.11.1`)
Notice in the second flow we're mapping the PMML model inputs in the PMML XML file with the properties in our enriched payload. Make sure the modelLocation variable has the right URL to your PMML model endpoint. 

==== Deploying the first stream - enriching the payload

16 - Deploy the first flow and see now you have three new applications running on CF

```

```

17 - Once the apps are running, start tailing the logs of the "dataflow-fromgem-log" app and then run the TransactionsEmulator again (see step 7 above). You should start seeing transactions + enriched data being logged.

Notice the `homeLocation` and `distance` attributes on the payload. They were added by the enricher processor.

==== Deploying the second stream to SCDF - evaluating against the PMML model

18 - Deploy the second stream `eval` and see now you have two new applications running on CF

```

Notice the added variable `output` and its `result` mapping to a cluster number. You can also find information about the cluster mapping algorithm used (euclidean distance) and information about each cluster by their numbers.
*The value of `output.result` for each transaction is one of the clusters (starting at 1) defined at the trained model (see step 12 above)*

==== Deploying the third stream to SCDF - filtering high-risk transactions and inserting back to GemFire

20 - Create and deploy the third stream to SCDF, called `result`

```
result = :eval.pmml > filter --expression=payload._output.result.toString().equals('2')  | gemfire --region-name=Suspect --host-addresses=geode-server:10334 --keyExpression=payload.id.toString()
```

Notice we're filtering only the transactions which are mapped to cluster number 3 in this example. Make sure you filter by a cluster number which is receiving a good amount of transactions, so you can show them in the TransactionsConsole app.

Notice the new applications deployed to CF by this new stream. 

21 - Now run the `TransactionsEmulator` once more (check step 7) and check the `TransactionsConsole UI`. You should see some red/orange transactions in the map and their information on the associated box.

In case you were successful until this point and haven't seen the flagged transactions coming in the UI:
* Check the logs for the new two apps deployed by the third stream
* Redeploy the third stream, filtering by a different cluster.

=== Appendices

==== Appendix1: PostgreSQL Setup

* Enable Postgres TCP/IP socket. Edit `postgresql.conf` and make sure `listen_addresses` is set to `*`.
* Enable client authentication. Eidt `pg_hba.conf` and add `host all all 192.168.11.11/32 trust` entry.
* Create user and database
Open psql as super user `psql -p5432` and run:
```
CREATE USER pivotal WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN;
ALTER ROLE pivotal WITH PASSWORD 'pivotal';
CREATE DATABASE gemfire;
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE gemfire TO pivotal;
```

* Edit the `model_postgres.sql` to set the absolute path to the CSV files.
```
COPY transaction FROM '<absolute path>/FraudDetection-DataMicroservices/scripts/transaction.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;	
COPY zip_codes FROM '<absolute path>/FraudDetection-DataMicroservices/scripts/zip_codes_states.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
COPY pos_device FROM '<absolute path>/FraudDetection-DataMicroservices/scripts/pos_device.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

* Create DDL and load the data
```
cd scripts
psql -p5432 -U pivotal -d gemfire -f model_postgres.sql
```
